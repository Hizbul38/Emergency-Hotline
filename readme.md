What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Answer No 3: 
Event bubbling is a type of DOM event process where an event start from the core element  and move up to its parent or grandparent.  It works by first triggering the event on the target element, and then the event moves upward through its parent elements, all the way up to the html element. Each parent can handle the event if it has an event listener.
